    "\n",
    "* Memory Efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "    A normal function to return a sequence will create the entire sequence in memory before returning the result. This is an overkill if the number of items in the sequence is very large. Generator implementation of such sequence is memory friendly and is preferred since it only produces one item at a time.\n",

    "* Represent Infinite Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "    Generators are excellent medium to represent an infinite stream of data. Infinite streams cannot be stored in memory and since generators produce only one item at a time, it can represent infinite stream of data.\n",
